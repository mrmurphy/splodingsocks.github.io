## Performing AJAX Requests in an Elm app

I've been spending time with Elm lately. It's the most comfortable path I've found into the Haskell-ish world of pure functional programming. I've been attempting to become proficient in Haskell for almost a year now (given, mostly only with a few hours of spare time here and there) and have time and again run into frustration with difficult theoretical concepts, and a percieved lack of productivity.

But I have been able to make headway with Elm. The language is designed in such a way that much less contextual knowledge is needed just to get started.

That said, it still takes a bit of mind-expansion to understand how to do things in Elm that are trivial in Javascript (like make AJAX requests). This is because Elm encourages the developer to incorporate the concept of linear time into her program structure, and to address up-front all possible branches of behavior her app might take. 

Elm provides tools for addressing these concepts:

## Signals

## Maybes
