After conversations with friends, I decided to dive in and give [Elm](http://elm-lang.org) a try. I began to appreciate it right away, and after only a few days of learning, I'm able to write basic apps with it (that's much faster than my Haskell experience so far :D).

I gave a little talk about what I've learned at the Utah JS Orem meet-up for August of 2015. Here's a screen-and-voice recording of the talk. It's a crash-course for beginners of Elm, given by a beginner of Elm, so expect good measures of assumption and mis-information.

That's all!
